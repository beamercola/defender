        <p>
          It is of timely importance that I inform you that The San Francisco
          Office of the Public Defender is embarking on an urgent storytelling
          project to continue the legacy of the late San Francisco Public
          Defender and crusader of justice, Jeff Adachi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The murder of George Floyd has once again revealed our racist and
          broken criminal justice system, just as the Pandemic has exposed the
          layers of failure of our Healthcare System.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we know the names of some of the victims, the tentacles of
          racism and violence of our failed Public Safety systems reach far and
          deep into our socio-economically marginalized communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these communities that have been ravaged by generational
          injustice, Public Defenders are the last lifeline of Democracy.
          Defenders protect the most vulnerable members of our community.
          Defenders hold the system accountable. Defenders expose the systemâ€™s
          complicit role in the administration of injustice. Defenders advocate
          for reform and systemic change.
        </p>
        <p>Above all, Defenders fight back.</p>
        <p>
          We, The Office of the Public Defender, with our partners Even/Odd
          Films, and Compound, will maintain the following tenants as we set
          forth on this unprecedented project, pending Board of Supervisor
          approval:
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          We will be compassionate, relentless, and courageous.
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          We will reveal the resilience, power, and potential of our most
          vulnerable communities.
        </p>
        <p className="italic">We will advocate for Police reform.</p>
        <p className="italic">
          We will advocate for the end of the mass incarceration system that has
          devastated our society.
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          We will expose unjust and racist immigration laws.
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          We will burn the flame of hopefulness, because we know that
          <strong>hopelessness is the enemy of justice</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>All power belongs to the people,</p>
